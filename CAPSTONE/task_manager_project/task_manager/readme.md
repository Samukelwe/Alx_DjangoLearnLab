This is my ALX BE capstone project, it is the culmination of what I have learned over the past couple of months.

It is a task management API to help busy people manage their day to day tasks with ease.

Using this API one is able, to add, view, edit and delete tasks as well as include their due date, priority and completion status.

I have managed to do this through the support of my mentors and friends namely Brian Kaheru, Fortunate Alinda and Adamou Nikiema.
